# Rails Engine

By Deonte Cooper

This project is the first individual project in Mod 3 at Turing School of Software & Design.

## Objective

I used Rails and ActiveRecord to build a JSON API, which exposes the SalesEngine data schema. I also
learned how to to build Single-Responsibility controllers to provide a well-designed and versioned
API, how to use controller tests to drive my design, and used Ruby and ActiveRecord to perform more
complicated business intelligence.
